ROS Noetic is the latest long-term support (LTS) version of ROS and will receive updates until **May 2025**. 
Ubuntu is preferred by many ROS users because it has a large user base, which means there is extensive community support.
If you run into any issues with ROS packages, you can consult the following resources:

- **[ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/)**: Detailed documentation for ROS.
- **[ROS Answers](https://answers.ros.org/)**: A Q&A forum for troubleshooting and community support.
